# XLMS2MC
### Description:
XLMS2MC is a project that allows you to use excel's powerful iterable tools to create commands inside a spreadsheet, and then export them to your Minecraft world.
### Usage:
To start, create a file in excel or google sheets (you just need to be able to export it into .xlms). The way the spreadsheet translates to minecraft is simple. The columns of the spreadsheet represent z values, and the rows represent x values (all y values are 0). For example, something in square A1 would be in block (0, 0, 0) in minecraft. Don't worry, though, you can set the position of A1 in your minecraft world to specify a start position. For example if you set A1 to be (2, 2, 2), then A2 would be (2, 2, 1).
